    "question": "What is an array in js and what do you use an array for?",
    "answer": "It's a type of object that's used to store data.  It's an ordered collection with associated indexes starting with 0."
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "question": "When would you use an object instead of an array?",
    "answer": "You'd use an object to associate values with specific keys.  These have named properties versus arrays which have numbered indexes."
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "question": "What is a function?",
    "answer": "A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.  It usually takes an input and returns an output"
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "question": "What is the difference between a regular function and an asynchronous function?",
    "answer": "Regular functions execute synchronously, which is line by line. It waits for each step to finish before moving on. Whereas an asynchronous function can perform operations without waiting for previous operations to complete"
  },
  {
    "id": 5,
    "question": "What is your process in error handling?",
    "answer": "Firstly read the error and try to comprehend what's going on.  Track the error back to the line it's coming from. If the error is coming from inside a function, walk through how the function is supposed to work.  There are several ways to eliminate the problem, you can console log as needed to ensure your supposed be receiving the correct output.  You can also use stack overflow or google and paste the error there to eliminate what the issue might be."
  },
  {
    "id": 6,
    "question": "What is a closure?",
    "answer": "A closure in JavaScript is a function that retains access to its lexical scope or outer scope, even after the function is done executing. I guess you could say they 'remember' the environment where they were created"
  },
  {
    "id": 7,
    "question": "What is a pure function?",
    "answer": "It has no side effects and given the same input, it'll always return the same output."
  },
  {
    "id": 8,
    "question": "What is javascript?",
    "answer": "It's a programming language written to be used with the DOM or web browser as a scripting language with HTML and CSS."
  },
  {
    "id": 9,
    "question": "Explain a REST API",
    "answer": "An API or application programming interface, allows you to connect an application to another application.  REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It's a standard for creating the application and uses HTTP methods like get, post, put and delete."
  },
  {
    "id": 10,
    "question": "What is one way you can store authentication information to share with other components or pages?",
    "answer": "A cookie, or local storage, or session storage"
  },
  {
    "id": 11,
    "question": "Explain the this keyword.",
    "answer": "The this keyword refers to or points to the context in which a function is executed or in other words, it refers to the current calling context. The value of the this keyword depends on how the function is called.  For example, as a method or object, this refers to the owner of that method or object.  In an arrow function, they inherit their value from the enclosing scope or lexical scope where they're defined."
  },
  {
    "id": 12,
    "question": "What is scope?",
    "answer": "In JavaScript, scope refers to the context in which variables, functions, and objects are accessible. It determines where variables can be declared, used, and modified. There's the global scope and local scope."
  },
  {
    "id": 13,
    "question": "Explain asynchronous programming.",
    "answer": "JavaScript is traditionally single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one operation at a time. However, many tasks (like fetching data from a server, reading files, or waiting for a timer) can take time, and we don't want these operations to block the main thread. This is where asynchronous programming comes in. Asynchronous programming allows JavaScript to handle long-running tasks without stopping the execution of the main program. Instead of waiting for a task to complete, JavaScript can continue executing other code and handle the task's result when itâ€™s done."
  },
  {
    "id": 14,
    "question": "Explain async/await.",
    "answer": "Async/await is a way of handling promises. You start your function with async and you await the promise to be returned before moving on to the next line"
  },
  {
    "id": 15,
    "question": "Difference between let, const, and var.",
    "answer": "Const can't be reassigned.  Let and var can be reassigned but the difference is, with var it's not block scoped."
  },
  {
    "id": 16,
    "question": "What is hoisting?",
    "answer": "Javascript reads code from top to bottom, one line at a time.  Hoisting lifts your function declarations to the top of your code.  This means if you call that function before it declared, it still works.  That's hoisting. Function expressions do not get hoisted, neither does using let or const.  Var on the other hand, gets hoisted but is only initialized as undefined.  So this still technically doesn't work with var."
  },
  {
    "id": 17,
    "question": "What are the different data types in Javascript?",
    "answer": "Number, string, boolean, Null, undefinded"
  },
  {
    "id": 18,
    "question": "What's the difference between null and undefined?",
    "answer": "Null represents no value or an empty value, while undefined is a variable that's been declared but not assigned a value."
  },
  {
    "id": 19,
    "question": "What's event delegation in javascript?",
    "answer": "It's a technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element. That listener will handle events occuring in the parent's child elements.  This helps optimize performance by reducing memory consumption"
